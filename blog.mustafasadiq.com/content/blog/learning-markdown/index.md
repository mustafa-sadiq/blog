### Introduction

In this blog post I am going to share why you should learn 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank">Markdown</a> and why it is an excellent tool for everyone to understand and make their text based delivery more efficient and formatted. Fun fact: this blog is written in Markdown!

> Yes, this blog is written in Markdown!

### Markdown syntax, easy to remember

Markdown syntax is easy, widely used, even you may have used it to type Bold or Italic styled text in Instant Messaging applications.

- You can make any text **Bold** by enclosing it in double asterisks.
- You can highlight a code snippet `print("hello world!")` by enclosing it in backticks.
- You can create a formatted list by using a dash:
    - This is a sub list.
- You can mention a quote by starting it with a Angle bracket: 
    > Did you see Mustafa's new blog?

All without moving your fingers off the keyboard.

### Making text delivery efficient and formatted

Let's compare two messages sent through *Microsoft Teams* with and without Markdown formatting:

> #### Example 1:
> ##### Plaintext
> Should I deploy this to PROD and include the release 1.2.3?
> ##### Markdown
> Should I deploy this to `PROD` and include the release `1.2.3`?

> #### Example 2:
> ##### Plaintext
> I am getting this error and am not able to figure it out. Can you help? Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "Invalid"
>    at java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:65)
>    at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:580)
>    at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:615)
>    at set07102.MyClass.main(MyClass.java:68)
> ##### Markdown
> I am getting this error and am not able to figure it out. Can you help? 
> ```
> Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "Invalid"
>   at java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:65)
>   at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:580)
>   at java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:615)
>   at set07102.MyClass.main(MyClass.java:68)


### Conclusion

Markdown is supported widely, works cross platforms, is easy to remember and increases your typing speed. As a result, you can make text based delivery more easy to understand without lifting fingers off your keyboard. 

I hope you will try it out in your next *Microsoft Teams* or *Discord* message.
